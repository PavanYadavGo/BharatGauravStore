                    Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made within <strong>10 days</strong> of placing the
                    order. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to
                    such sellers / merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they have initiated the process of shipping
                    them, or the product is out for delivery. In such an event, you may choose to reject the product at
                    the doorstep.
